## Issues

If you found a bug and want to report it, or if you have an idea for a feature for GENis, [create an issue](https://github.com/fundacion-sadosky/genis/issues/new).
When generating an issue, please use a concise title, a detailed description of the problem and mention the processes it impacts.

## Pull Requests

* The PR must have the issue(s) it resolves linked. This can be done by typing `Fixes #<Numero de issue>` in the PR description. This allows the issue to be automatically closed when the PR is merged.
* If the PR includes visual changes, you are encouraged to include screen captures showing the change.
* Every change or addition must include its own automated tests, either unit or integration tests.
* Every test should pass.
